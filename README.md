## LIBFT

This project is the very first project as a student at 42. I was need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that I will use during my whole cursus.

## How to Use

 You can use any function included in the library directly into your file.c by calling it's name and including the archive file during compile.

#### Archive the library:

```bash
  make libft.a
  make bonus
```
    
#### You can compile your main file this way:
```bash
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra main.c libft.a
```
#### Run the program now:
```bash
    ./a.out 
```
